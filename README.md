## Description

A simple maze game that requires the player to collect keys to unlock the gates and reach the goal.

---

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Loads JSON levels (preload)
- Builds Level objects
- Creates/positions the Player
- Handles input + level switching

It is intentionally light on "details" because those are moved into:

- Level.js (grid + drawing + tile meaning)
- Player.js (position + movement rules)

## Assets

N/A

---

## GenAI

The code was mainly generated by CoPilot. The Basic maze layout was coded by AI but manually rewritten by Cheryl.
